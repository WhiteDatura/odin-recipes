# odin-recipes
Hello, I'm Ed and this is the first project I worked on following THE ODIN PROJECT curriculum.

In this project I'll demonstrate the html fundamentals learned thought the first part of the curriculum.
This includes but is not limited too:
    -Building a html boilerplate from scratch.
    -Using headings, paragraphs
    -Using different text markers
    -Usage of relative and absolute links
    -Usage of images
    -Usage of Git Hub

I know that a long road awaits ahead of me, but I look forward to it.

Thanks for reading stranger, whoever you are, wish you the best on your goals!
